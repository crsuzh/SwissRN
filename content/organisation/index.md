**Become a SwissRN Institution**

We expect that institutions seeking membership of SwissRN will want to develop capacity to deliver a research improvement strategy, and to work with SwissRN to develop a strategy for ensuring the sustainability of SwissRN in the medium- and long-term, and to build a community of institutions focused on research improvement.

Interested institutions please send an email to [Eva Furrer](mailto:eva.furrer@uzh.ch).

### Stakeholders  {#stakeholders}  
Stakeholders who support the SwissRN form the Stakeholder Engagement Group with the goal of

* aligning SwissRN activity with the strategy and activity of the stakeholders
* allowing the exchange of ideas
