Stakeholders who support the SwissRN form the Stakeholder Engagement Group. This ensures that SwissRN activity is aligned with the strategy and activity of the stakeholders, and allows the exchange of ideas. In addition, the relationship between the Stakeholder Engagement Group and the SwissRN provides stakeholders with a mechanism for obtaining feedback on new initiatives from the research community. See Annex 5: Potential Stakeholders in Switzerland.
