The Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) is a peer-led consortium that aims to promote and ensure rigorous research practices in Switzerland by


* establishing appropriate training activities, 
* designing and evaluating research improvement efforts, 
* disseminating best practice, 
* working with stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector. 

SwissRN is currently led by Leonhard Held (University of Zurich), Evie Vergauwe (University of Geneva) and Hanno W&uuml;rbel (University of Bern).

Poor research reproducibility and replicability affects all empirical disciplines, hence SwissRN aims for broad disciplinary representation and an intensive interdisciplinary dialogue.
