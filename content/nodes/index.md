Nodes, or Local Networks, provide a mechanism through which the aims of the SwissRN can be promoted within that institution (e.g., by establishing open research working groups, running training workshops, advocating for the wider adoption of best practice within the institution, etc.).



## Local Network Leads
A Local Network Lead provides the point of contact for SwissRN, and represents a grass-roots network of researchers at that institution. It is intended that these Local Networks will grow, both in number and size, over time, as researchers elect to participate in SwissRN activities. Local Networks are self-organizing, but we encourage them to ensure their membership is open to academic and research staff (at all levels) and professional services staff.
