### Preregistration and Registered Reports{#prereg}
Preregistration, or the practice of documenting research aspects such as hypothesis, sample size, design, data exclusion, and statistical analyses, before data collection or data analysis, can help reducing questionable research practices. When integrated into the publishing process in the form of Registered Reports, it can also reduce publication bias. The aim of the SwissRN working group on preregistration and Registered Reports is to promote and support existing initiatives and services related to preregistration and Registered Reports (e.g., through workshops and consulting service), as well as to develop new initiatives with stakeholders.

### Research Assessment and Incentives{#assess}
Trustworthiness of research is unevitably linked to robustness, rigor and transparency. But the assessment of researchers for hiring and promotion rarely emphasizes behaviors that contribute to these factors. The SwissRN working group will be discussing possibilities to reward and recognize researchers for such behavior. In a dialogue with institutions and stakeholders the group will push for a change of culture. See the [Hongkong Principles](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737) for a starting point.

### Replication Studies{#replicate}
Replication studies are essential to confirm, expand, or refute claims of new discoveries. Although replication has long been a central part of the scientific method, the so-called replication crisis has led to increased interest in replication over the last decade. The SwissRN working group on replication studies aims to discuss all aspects of the
design, conduct and analysis of replication studies and to share best practices through trainings and workshops.

### Research Methodology{#methods}
Reproducibility of research findings essentially depends on rigorous research methodology, including the selection of the study population to represent the target population, study design to control for potential confounders, study conduct to minimise risks of bias, adequate data analysis, and balanced interpretation of results. The aim of the SwissRN working group on research methodology is to promote rigorous research methods, with a view to commonalities and differences across different research disciplines, and to engage with different stakeholders to facilitate dissemination and uptake.

### ReproducibiliTea{#reprotea}
ReproducibiliTea is a grassroots journal club initiative that helps researchers create local Open Science journal clubs at their universities to discuss diverse issues, papers and ideas about improving science, reproducibility and the Open Science movement, see [https://reproducibilitea.org/](https://www.crs.uzh.ch/en/training/ReproducibiliTea.html).
