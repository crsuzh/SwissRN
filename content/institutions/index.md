## Become a SwissRN Institution
We expect that institutions seeking membership of SwissRN will want to develop capacity to deliver a research improvement strategy, and to work with SwissRN to develop a strategy for ensuring the sustainability of SwissRN in the medium- and long-term, and to build a community of institutions focused on research improvement.

Interested institutions please send an email to [Eva Furrer](mailto:eva.furrer@uzh.ch).
