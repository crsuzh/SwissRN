# {#UrsaBernadic}

|  [Ursa Bernardic](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5503-9736) | Current practices in marketing and management journals |
| ----------- | :----------- |
||My aim is to investigate the current practices for replicability and transparency in the top marketing and management journals. This project will review the current practices in journals (concerning data sharing, preregistration, registered reports), and compare them to advances in connected fields (i.e. economics, psychology, neuroscience). These insights will be used to 1) provide the current state of the art in marketing and management journals, 2) design a qualitative questionnaire examining the view of stakeholders (to be collected in the conference), 3) inform journal policies about possible improvements. |
||Supervisor: Giuseppe Ugazio|

|  [Charlotte Micheloud](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-4505) | Reverse-Bayes Design and Analysis of Replication Studies |
| ----------- | :----------- |
||Replication studies are receiving a lot of attention in most empirical domains of science. However, there is no consensus on how to design and analyze them. The aim of my project is to further develop a new quantitative measure for the assessment of replication success based on a reverse-Bayes approach: the sceptical p-value. In particular, I am extending this approach to equivalence and non-inferiority studies, and to sequential designs. |

# {#MariannaRosso}

|  [Marianna Rosso](https://www.tierschutz.vetsuisse.unibe.ch/about_us/personnel/rosso_marianna/index_eng.html) | Improving the reproducibility and translatability of animal models|
| ----------- | :----------- |
||My project aims at assessing and improving the reproducibility and translatability of animal models by using systematic reviews of published literature and meta-analyses. In particular, I study the sensitivity and specificity of mouse behavioural tests of anxiety to drugs with verified anxiolytic effects in humans. My goal is to improve the scientific quality of animal science and ensure a more responsible use of animals in research.  |
