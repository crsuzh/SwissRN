### Organisation and membership

The Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) Academy is a group of Early Career Researchers from Swiss universities who are interested in reproducibility, metascience, good research practices, and transparency.
Our goal is improving the quality of science by sharing our knowledge of reproducible research with students and researchers. We want to create a national network among young researchers from various fields and backgrounds, that enables interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. **We’d be happy to see our community grow!**

If you are interested in these or related topics, feel free to contact us to find out how to join and contribute: [SwissRN academy](mailto:samuel.pawel@uzh.ch)


Other Reproducibility Networks have established similar academies, such as the [UKRN Academy](https://www.ukrn.org/ukrn-academy/).

# {#UrsaBernadic}

|  [Ursa Bernardic](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5503-9736) | Current practices in marketing and management journals |
| ----------- | :----------- |
||My aim is to investigate the current practices for replicability and transparency in the top marketing and management journals (concerning data sharing, preregistration, registered reports), and compare them to advances in connected fields (i.e. economics, psychology, neuroscience). These insights will be used to 1) provide the current state of the art in marketing and management journals, 2) design a qualitative questionnaire examining the view of stakeholders, 3) inform journal policies about possible improvements. |
||Supervisor: Giuseppe Ugazio| 

#  {#CharlotteMicheloud}

|  [Charlotte Micheloud](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-4505) | Reverse-Bayes design and analysis of replication studies |
| ----------- | :----------- |
||Replication studies are receiving a lot of attention in most empirical domains of science. However, there is no consensus on how to design and analyse them. The aim of my project is to further develop a new quantitative measure for the assessment of replication success based on a reverse-Bayes approach: the sceptical p-value. In particular, I am extending this approach to equivalence and non-inferiority studies, and to sequential designs. |
||Supervisor: Leonhard Held| 

#  {#SamuelPawel}

|  [Samuel Pawel](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2779-320X) | Reverse-Bayes design and analysis of replication studies |
| ----------- | :----------- |
||The focus of my PhD is Bayesian methodology for the analysis and design of replication studies. Specifically, I am investigating the combination of reverse-Bayes methods with Bayesian hypothesis testing. The aim of the project is to study theoretical properties of the approach, but also to provide scientists with computational tools that allow them to easily apply it to their research. |
||Supervisor: Leonhard Held| 


# {#MariannaRosso}

|  [Marianna Rosso](https://www.tierschutz.vetsuisse.unibe.ch/about_us/personnel/rosso_marianna/index_eng.html) | Improving the reproducibility and translatability of animal models|
| ----------- | :----------- |
||My project aims at assessing and improving the reproducibility and translatability of animal models by using systematic reviews of published literature and meta-analyses. In particular, I study the sensitivity and specificity of mouse behavioural tests of anxiety to drugs with verified anxiolytic effects in humans. My goal is to improve the scientific quality of animal science and ensure a more responsible use of animals in research.  |
