### Organisation and membership

The Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) Academy is a group of Early Career Researchers from Swiss universities who are interested in reproducibility, metascience, good research practices, and transparency.
Our goal is improving the quality of science by sharing our knowledge of reproducible research with students and researchers. We want to create a national network among young researchers from various fields and backgrounds, that enables interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. **We’d be happy to see our community grow!**

If you are interested in these or related topics, feel free to contact us to find out how to join and contribute: [SwissRN academy](mailto:samuel.pawel@uzh.ch)


Other Reproducibility Networks have established similar academies, such as the [UKRN Academy](https://www.ukrn.org/ukrn-academy/).

|<span style="font-weight:normal">Ursa has a PhD in Marketing and Management and is currently a Postdoctoralresearcher at CEPE, ETH Zürich. During her PhD, she was interested in open science practices in marketing and management journals, and worked on prosocial behavior, inequality perception, and developing more objective marketing measures. Currently, she is dedicated to conducting preregisteredRandomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to increase sustainable behavior. Ursa's commitment to open science is evident as she preregisters all her studies and readily shares data, code, and experiment scripts on the Open ScienceFramework (OSF). Furthermore, she has actively joined the Swiss ResearchNetwork (SwissRN) to advocate for these principles among her colleagues.</span> |

|<span style="font-weight:normal">Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled worldwide, despite existing technologies to do so. As part of the Global Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich, my research seeks to engineer solutions that work in low-resource contexts. Open-science and reproducibility can facilitate multiplier effects of plastic recycling solutions, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In pursuit of this, I aim to provide transparency and credit to the people and methods that contribute to my PhD research.</span> |

| :----------- |
|<span style="font-weight:normal">I am a researcher with a PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of Amsterdam. In my research I used different non-invasive neuroimaging techniques (electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging) and methodological approaches (e.g., computational models) to study audiovisual learning in children and adults. In Zurich I worked at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and at the Neurolinguistics group in the Psychology Department. My current focus is on using my experiences with diverse types of data, methodologies, and researchers to improve reproducibility and open science.</span> |

|<span style="font-weight:normal">I am currently in the final stages of my PhD in Biostatistics. My research focuses on methodological aspects of replicability. Specifically, I am developing new methods for the design and the analysis of replication studies. My PhD journey made me realize the importance of good research practices, reproducibility and transparency. Furthermore, I am a strong advocate of open science and believe that research outputs should be available to everyone.</span> |

| :----------- |
|<span style="font-weight:normal">I am a trained statistician with a PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. During my PhD I worked on statistical methodology for the design and analysis of replication studies. I am generally interested in statistics, meta-research and their intersection. My current work includes statistical research for evidence assessment and meta-research on methodological research, for example, on the reporting of simulation studies. I believe that transparency and openness are essential for the credibility of research. I try to make my research reproducible and openly available, and to promote these principles among my colleagues and peers.</span> |

|<span style="font-weight:normal">As a dedicated Research Fellow at the Center of Reproducible Science, I am committed to advancing the field of animal welfare and scientific rigor. My work primarily focuses on advancing systematic review methodology, emphasizing the critical importance of reproducibility in research. My team and I are working on the development of automated systematic review methodologies, aiming at facilitating the way we synthesize scientific evidence. <br>Furthermore, our research aims at improving the translation of findings from animal studies to human therapies in neuroscience. My passion lies in fostering a culture of transparency, rigor, and ethical considerations, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of scientific practices and the betterment of society.</span> |
