The Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) is a peer-led consortium that aims to promote and ensure rigorous research practices in Switzerland. SwissRNâ€™s special focus is on reproducibility/replicability. With the goal of supporting and highlighting the work of young scholars who are paying special attention to such issues in their work, **SwissRN invites nominations for three annual Swiss Reproducibility Awards.**

**Criteria**
- One award is granted in each scientific category: Humanities and Social Sciences; Mathematics, Natural and Engineering Sciences; and Biology and Medicine.  
- Published, submitted manuscripts or preprints, or other relevant research output (e.g. open-source software packages, openly shared data including appropriate metadata) by researchers who were PhD or Master students at a Swiss Higher education institution during the conduct of the submitted work are eligible.  
- Publication has to be within the last two years, other research output within the last year before the SwissRN Annual Meeting.  
- The submission must adhere to the highest standards of reproducibility. It can be a fully reproducible empirical study, a systematic review, a methodological paper with supplementary software or any other contribution that submitters deem relevant.  

**Nomination process**
A letter of nomination (300 words) may be submitted for an eligible research output. Self-nomination is encouraged. 

**Review process**
The SwissRN Steering Committee and the SwissRN advisory board will select the winners from the nominated manuscripts while soliciting additional expertise from external reviewers as needed.

**Award**
The three recipients will receive a cash award of CHF 500 along with an official certificate at the SwissRN Annual Meeting. The awardees are expected to give a brief presentation about their work.


**Submit nomination**
To submit your nomination, visit the [2022 Swiss Reproducibility Award Nominations Form](https://forms.gle/Wt8xYwhfEq4ta7SG9) and submit **before June 30th**. SwissRN encourages applications from all sections of the community irrespective of gender, race, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability or age.
