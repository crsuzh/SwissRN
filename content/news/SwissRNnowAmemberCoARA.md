After SwissRN signed the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment in April 2023, we have now also become a member of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). 

This enables SwissRN members to collaborate in the CoARA Working Groups, currently set up by and allows you to participate in the call to found Working Groups, in case your own university is not a member itself. The call was launched end of March 2023 and will be completed in autumn 2023. The second cut-off date for the submission for proposals will be in autumn this year (tbd). You find the [call documents here](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2023/03/CoARA_Call_for_WGs_Final.pdf). If you are interested to participate or join an existing proposal, please have a look on the [CoARA website](https://coara.eu/coalition/working-groups/), there you will be provided with all relevant documents. It is a great opportunity to advance, promote, and ensure rigorous, transparent and reproducible research practices by contributing to reforming research assessment.
