The first event of the Swiss Reproducibility Network Academy will take place online on Friday, February 25 from 16:00 to 17:15.
   
It will be an informal event where we will talk about why reproducibility and open science matter to us/you. We will also discuss future events. The (tentative) program is the following:  
   
16:00 - 16:30 : presentations (from us/you) + discussion
16:30 - 16:50 : networking (getting to know each other)
16:50 - 17:15 : future activities + closing remarks  
   
We would be very happy to see you then, and for easier organization please fill out the very short survey if you plan to join: https://forms.gle/udUT5eJqv8ZJwrz47 
   
If you have any questions, feel free to reach us by email (swissrnacademy@gmail.com).  Please feel free to spread the word, and forward this invitation to anyone that might be interested in joining us.
   
Best wishes,  
Ursa, Marianna, Samuel and Charlotte
