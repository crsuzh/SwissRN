**Bern Local Node News: Reproducibility Hackathon, May 5<sup>th</sup> 2023**

As a first activity for this year the Bern node of the SwissRN is organizing a **Reproducibility Hackathon** on **May 5<sup>th</sup>**. The aim of the Hackathon is to investigate whether current practice of preregistration does indeed reduce researcher's degrees of freedom to an extent that the analysis of study outcomes becomes reproducible. The Hackathon is a one-day on-site event in Bern (Friday, May 5<sup>th</sup>; though for students there is a pre-event lecture on May 4<sup>th</sup> covering principles of reproducibility, pre-registration, open data as well as a recap of mixed effect model analysis.) Participating students can get 1 ECTS point, all participants will get coffee, cake, and pizza ad lib.
