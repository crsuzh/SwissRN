The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) joined forces to launch the Swiss Reproducibility Awards 2024. With the goal of supporting and highlighting the work of early career researchers as well as research teams who are paying special attention to rigour, transparency and reproducibility in their research, the SNSF and the SwissRN invite nominations for the Swiss Reproducibility Award. The call will be published early December, so stay tuned!
