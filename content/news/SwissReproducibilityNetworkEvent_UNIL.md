Swiss Reproducibility Network (SwissRN) invites interested researchers to get to know more about our network and how researchers can engage with and benefit from its activities. We also present two SwissRN projects which are co-financed by swissuniversities. One focusses on reusability and interoperability of research outputs and the other on open educational resources on topics like reproducibility. At the end of the event we have the opportunity to exchange at the apéro.   

**Date, Time**: 15. November 2023, 15.00 - 17.00 <br>
