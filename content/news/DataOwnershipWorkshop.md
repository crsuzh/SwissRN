**Panel Discussion: Who Owns the Data? – December 5<sup>th</sup> 2024, 15:00-17:30, Bern**
 
Recent discussions regarding the reproducibility and efficiency of science have instigated institutions, funders, and publishers to promote or demand more transparency, open data, data sharing and data re-use. As such practices open up questions regarding data ownership, usage rights and responsibilities, the Swiss Reproducibility Network in Bern is organizing a panel discussion, where legal experts and researchers will discuss issues around production and ownership of research data in basic science.
 
**Invited Experts:**
 - Franziska Bächler (University Basel)
 - Suzanna Marazza (CC digital law)
 - Felix Magin (University Konstanz)
