### Seminar “Reproducibility in biomedical research”, 12.04.2024

Reproducibility is crucial in the scientific process, where our ultimate goal is to provide reliable and useful results. The so-called reproducibility crisis has triggered many studies to analyze the problem and proposals to address it. In this seminar, speakers from different organizations will discuss reproducibility in biomedical research. They will cover the topic from different perspectives, ranging from applications in preclinical science, in biomarker development and GWAS studies, to a statistical, computational, and societal point of view. We hope that many of you can attend this exciting seminar. 
You can find the program and all information on the seminar [here](https://baselbiometrics.github.io/home/docs/upcoming/20240412/agenda.pdf).
