SwissRN member [Florian Cova](https://www.unige.ch/cisa/members/cova-florian/) is an author on the **retracted** paper "SARS-CoV-2 was Unexpectedly Deadlier than Push-scooters: Could Hydroxychloroquine be the Unique Solution?".

Shocked? Read what is mentioned on Retraction Watch:

"The retraction of a Trojan horse paper on the novel coronavirus has called into question the validity of another article in the same journal which found that hydroxychloroquine is effective against Covid-19."
