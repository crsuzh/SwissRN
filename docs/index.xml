Open Research Data In order to reproduce and replicate research findings, open and also FAIR research data are a prerequisite. However, publishing research data is still not a standard and studies show how difficult it is to gain access to research data upon request. The SwissRN working group aims to promote open research data, to improve and facilitate data management across different research disciplines, to provide a network to collaborate in Open Research Data projects (including project proposals for ORD calls) and to engage with different stakeholders to facilitate dissemination and uptake.</description>

      <description>Successful Reproducibility Hackathon Bern, May 5th 2023: First Findings
On May 5th 2023 the Bern node of the SwissRN organized a Reproducibility Hackathon. Thirteen people showed up, re-analysing the statistical analyses of pre-registered reports from the Reproducibility Project Cancer Biology. After eight hours of intense code hacking (with decent breaks for pizza and cake), over 60 confirmatory tests have been re-analysed. Participants got the original pre-registration protocol as well as the published data, while they did not see the code and the report of the study outcome published by the authors beforehand.</description>

Why Computational Reproducibility? Computational reproducibility is the ability to independently verify the results of a computational study using the same data and methods. It is a critical aspect of scientific research as it ensures the transparency and credibility of scientific findings. Computational reproducibility allows researchers to build upon the work of others, helping to accelerate scientific progress.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the SwissRN seminar series on Computational Reproducibility!
In today&amp;rsquo;s world, computational research has become an essential tool for advancing scientific knowledge and discovery. However, the increasing complexity of computational models and the abundance of data available for analysis can make it challenging to reproduce research results. Computational reproducibility is the ability to independently verify the results of a computational study using the same data and methods. It is a critical aspect of scientific research as it ensures the transparency and credibility of scientific findings.</description>

      <description>Bern Local Node News: Reproducibility Hackathon, May 5th 2023
As a first activity for this year the Bern node of the SwissRN is organizing a Reproducibility Hackathon on May 5th. The aim of the Hackathon is to investigate whether current practice of preregistration does indeed reduce researcher&amp;rsquo;s degrees of freedom to an extent that the analysis of study outcomes becomes reproducible. The Hackathon is a one-day on-site event in Bern (Friday, May 5th; though for students there is a pre-event lecture on May 4th covering principles of reproducibility, pre-registration, open data as well as a recap of mixed effect model analysis.</description>

      <description>The SwissRN is a grassroots movement â everybody can participate, no matter the field they work in, no matter if they are from a big or a small university or from another institution within academia, no matter if they are senior or junior. The common ground of these diverse researchers is the desire to increase reproducibility of research. The goal of the network is to benefit from diversity, to push for trustworthiness from the bottom up, and, quite simply, to promote a culture change towards a focus on quality rather than novelty.</description>
