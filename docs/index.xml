Preregistration and Registered Reports Preregistration, or the practice of documenting research aspects such as hypothesis, sample size, design, data exclusion, and statistical analyses, before data collection or data analysis, can help reduce questionable research practices. When integrated into the publishing process in the form of Registered Reports, it can also reduce publication bias. The aim of the SwissRN working group on Preregistration and Registered Reports is to promote and support existing initiatives and services related to Preregistration and Registered Reports (e.</description>

      <description>Organisation and membership The SwissRN Academy connects doctoral students at SwissRN member institutions who are working on topics related to reproducibility, research reliability, transparency, metascience or similar research topics. The SwissRN contact for the Academy is Leonhard Held. Other Reproducibility Networks have established similar academies, such as the UKRN Academy.

      <title>The Swiss Reproducibility Network - many fields, different voices</title>

      <description>The SwissRN is a grassroots movement – everybody can participate, no matter the field they work in, no matter if they are from a big or a small university or from another institution within academia, no matter if they are senior or junior. The common ground of these diverse researchers is the desire to increase reproducibility of research. The goal of the network is to benefit from diversity, to push for trustworthiness from the bottom up, and, quite simply, to promote a culture change towards a focus on quality rather than novelty.</description>

      <description>On October 23rd, 2020 the Swiss Reproducibility Network had its official (virtual) launch meeting. Members of the advisory board and of other Reproducibility Networks and stakeholders presented their vision on the reproducibility of research. A lively discussion of view points and potential action points inspired the more informal afternoon in which SwissRN defined its future activities.
Working groups have been formed on
 Preregistration and Registered Reports: initial leader Evie Vergauwe Research Assessment and Incentives: initial leader Eva Furrer Replication Studies: initial leader Leonhard Held Research Methodology: initial leader Hanno Würbel Courses and course materials: initial leader Simon Schwab Journal club and communication: initial leader Eva Furrer  More details on the working groups will be announced soon.</description>

      <description>SwissRN steering committee member Hanno Würbel is senior author on a publication that has been awarded the Best Negative Data Prize: Evaluation of the effects of space allowance on measures of animal welfare in laboratory mice.
&amp;ldquo;Established in 2018 by the Global Preclinical Data Forum (GPDF) and co-sponsored by CVB, a non-profit research biotech, and the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP), the Best Negative Data Prize aims to highlight the value to negative data—or data where the results do not confirm the expected outcomes or original hypotheses—toward advancing knowledge in neuroscience, providing an incentive for preclinical researchers to publish their &amp;ldquo;negative data&amp;rdquo; results.</description>

      <description>SwissRN member Florian Cova is an author on the retracted paper &amp;ldquo;SARS-CoV-2 was Unexpectedly Deadlier than Push-scooters: Could Hydroxychloroquine be the Unique Solution?&amp;rdquo;.
Shocked? Read what is mentioned on Retraction Watch:
&amp;ldquo;The retraction of a Trojan horse paper on the novel coronavirus has called into question the validity of another article in the same journal which found that hydroxychloroquine is effective against Covid-19.&amp;rdquo;
