<td style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:normal">My name is Chhavi Sachdeva, and I am currently a junior postdoctoral researcher at UniDistance Suisse, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nicolas Rothen. My research focuses on the link between visual perception and memory, using healthy special populations as my sample. I believe that the purpose of research is to benefit both other researchers and the general public. This is why I advocate for science to be both reproducible and open—reproducible so we can trust research, and open so it is accessible to a wider audience.</span></td>
