Open Research Data In order to reproduce and replicate research findings, open and also FAIR research data are a prerequisite. However, publishing research data is still not a standard and studies show how difficult it is to gain access to research data upon request. The SwissRN working group aims to promote open research data, to improve and facilitate data management across different research disciplines, to provide a network to collaborate in Open Research Data projects (including project proposals for ORD calls) and to engage with different stakeholders to facilitate dissemination and uptake.</description>

Why Computational Reproducibility? Computational reproducibility is the ability to independently verify the results of a computational study using the same data and methods. It is a critical aspect of scientific research as it ensures the transparency and credibility of scientific findings. Computational reproducibility allows researchers to build upon the work of others, helping to accelerate scientific progress.</description>

      <description>On October 23rd, 2020 the Swiss Reproducibility Network had its official (virtual) launch meeting. Members of the advisory board and of other Reproducibility Networks and stakeholders presented their vision on the reproducibility of research. A lively discussion of view points and potential action points inspired the more informal afternoon in which SwissRN defined its future activities.
Working groups have been formed on
Preregistration and Registered Reports: initial leader Evie Vergauwe Research Assessment and Incentives: initial leader Eva Furrer Replication Studies: initial leader Leonhard Held Research Methodology: initial leader Hanno WÃ¼rbel Courses and course materials: initial leader Simon Schwab Journal club and communication: initial leader Eva Furrer More details on the working groups will be announced soon.</description>
