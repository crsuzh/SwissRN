Preregistration and Registered Reports Preregistration, or the practice of documenting research aspects such as hypothesis, sample size, design, data exclusion, and statistical analyses, before data collection or data analysis, can help reduce questionable research practices. When integrated into the publishing process in the form of Registered Reports, it can also reduce publication bias.</description>
